# Master Plan!

## Redo lab1

- make UML diagram
- convert from inheritance to composition
- write or rewrite JUnit tests
- make interface IsVehicle and class GroundVehicle

## Lab2

## 1: Extensibility

### Part 1

- make file _Scania.java_ with class ScaniaTruck
- incorporate ScaniaTruck into existing hierarchy

### Part 2

- make IsTruck interface with trailer methods for example: raiseTrailer, lowerTrailer, getTrailerAngle...
- Implement IsTruck and add trailer methods and necessary variables to ScaniaTruck

#### Storage requirements

- 0 <= angle <= 70 deg 
- angle = 0 if truck is moving
- trailer can only be raised/lowered if truck speed == 0

### Part 3

- make JUnit tests and test everything 

## 2: More Extensibility

### Part 1

- make class CarTransport
- select model-name  and filename

### Part 2

- incorporate into existing hierarchy
- implement IsTruck and add trailer methods and variables

#### Storage requirements

- CarTransport ramp has two modes and can be upp or down
- ramp is up when CarTransport is moving
- 

## 3: Parametric Polymorphism
